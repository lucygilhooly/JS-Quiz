//when u visit website we want to have a homescreen with a button reading 'click here to play!'
// will need a function which changes the screen to the next (can possibly be reused when hitting the next question button)
// question screen should display an image and 4 options, one of them being correct. 
// will store all questions within an array as objects
//if else statement with booleans for correct or incorrect answers 
//figure out how to keep score? 
//maybe add function to an event listener that if correct answer is pressed a point is recorded 
//this would be stored in an array and should be displayed onscreen too
//also want a home button to permanantly be displayed at the top
